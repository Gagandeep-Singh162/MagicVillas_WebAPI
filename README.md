# My ASP.NET Core Web API Project

Hey there! Welcome to my **ASP.NET Core Web API** project! This is a personal project I’ve been working on to master building and consuming RESTful APIs using **.NET 7**. I started from the basics and have built a solid foundation, including a RESTful service with CRUD operations, authentication, and database integration. This README captures my journey so far, and I’ll keep it updated as I add more features!

## Project Overview

This is my take on a RESTful Web API built from scratch with **ASP.NET Core 7**. I wanted to create something practical and scalable, so I’ve implemented GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, hooked it up to a database, and added security with authentication and authorization. It’s been a great challenge to figure out how all the pieces—like Entity Framework, Swagger, and the repository pattern—fit together.

### Current Features
- **RESTful API**: Built endpoints for CRUD operations using **ASP.NET Core Web API**.
- **Repository Pattern**: Organized data access with a clean repository layer and **Entity Framework Core**.
- **Database Integration**: Set up **SQL Server** with code-first migrations to store data persistently.
- **HTTP Client**: Experimented with consuming the API using **HttpClient** in a separate app.

### Future Plans
I’m not done yet! I’m planning to:
- Polish the API with versioning support.
- Build a bigger front-end app to consume it (maybe with Angular!).
- Deploy the whole thing to **Azure** once it’s ready.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you’ll need:
- **C# Experience**: I’ve been coding in C# for about 6 months, so some basics are handy.
- **ASP.NET Core Knowledge**: A few months of .NET Core experience helps.
- **Visual Studio 2022**: My IDE of choice for this project.
- **SQL Server 2018**: For the database (managed via SQL Server Management Studio).
- **.NET 7 SDK**: Make sure you’ve got the right SDK installed.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gagandeep-Singh162/MagicVillas_WebAPI.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Set Up the Database:**
  Update the connection string in appsettings.json to point to your SQL Server instance.
  Run this command in the Package Manager Console to apply migrations:
